    <h1>TV Shows from my childhood that still hold up today</h1>
    <p>Now I know this is probably a strange topic for this assignment, but there are some TV Shows
        from when I was younger that I absolutely adore,
        and do to this day. So I wanted to share just
        a couple of these incredible shows with some images from my favorite scenes,
        and even a music video from youtube (totally not just because it's required...)
        But you can definitely <a href="#vids">Skip to those</a> if you want to :)
    </p>        
    <br>
  
    <br>
    <p>
        Really there are only 2 shows that I want to mention, and they are Phineas and Ferb, and Gravity falls. But what makes these shows so great? Good question.
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li><span class="bold">Humor:</span> 
            <ul>
                <li>Each show has some great jokes that still make me laugh as an adult</li>
            </ul>   
        </li><br>
        <li><span class="bold">Rewatch Potential:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>Both shows have an insanely high rewatch potential, and are go-to's if I'm ever feeling down</li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><span class="bold">Quality:</span> 
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Phineas and ferb has many high quality episodes even though it is purely episodic in nature (meaning you could 
                    watch an episode from the middle of the series and not miss out on any serious plot) 
                    Whereas Gravity Falls also has insanely high quality episodes, and is more serial (has a distinct overarching story)
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li><br>
        <li><span class="bold">Nostalgia:</span>
            <ul>
                <li>This one is pretty self explanatory, but basically I watched them when I was younger which makes them even better now</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Phineas and Ferb is also notorious for it's incredible music, with a new original song featured every episode. So I just wanted to take a minute and list out my top 5 Phineas and Ferb Songs.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Busted</li><br>
        <li>Ain't Got Rhythm</li><br>
        <li>Fabulous</li><br>
        <li>Evil Boys</li><br>
        <li>I love you Mom</li><br>
    </ol>
    <p id="vids">And even though I said I'd only put in one video, I'll attach all of those songs as videos for your viewing and listening pleasure.</p>
